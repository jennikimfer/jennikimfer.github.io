<p>welcome to my personal website xD</p>
<p>i'm jennifer, a current undergrad student at the massachusetts institute of technology majoring in <a href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics/undergraduate-programs/curriculum/6-3-computer-science-and-engineering/">6-3</a>.</p>
<p>i don't really plan for this site to be a portfolio, so don't expect anything groundbreaking. it's more for personal record.</p>
