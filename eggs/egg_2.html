    The woman wasn't supposed to be on the beach. The old man was. He always was. For as long as the 
    sun touches the horizon, the old man's feet will touch the sand. To him, she was a fallen angel, 
    one God would only allow back into Heaven if she could touch both ends of the unending shoreline 
    before the sea swallowed her whole. He pitied her. It was a fool's errand, and yet, she obsessively 
    clung to the brittle hope that her Father would see her desperation and forgive her, that she might 
    still be allowed to return to something like grace. It would be better for her to just accept her 
    newfound humanity. But, perhaps, that was the cruelty of it: to live as an angel and be asked to 
    endure as a human. Perhaps, to her, death was more palatable than becoming something less than what 
    she once was.
</p>

<p>
    The old man sighed. Indulging in these kinds of fanciful thoughts are harmless enough distractions, 
    but distractions nonetheless. There was still shoreline left unchecked.
</p>

<p>
    And right on cue, as if an omnipotent conductor had flicked his baton, the last sliver of Sun 
    slipped beneath the horizon, and the woman let out a guttural scream. It was hauntingly beautiful, 
    hearing her agony unravel into the empty expanse of the beach, seeing her body dissolve into the 
    Earth a little more with each wave that broke over her.
</p>

<p>
    Just as the old man felt himself falling under her spell, she vanished. Only the sound of waves 
    crashing onto the shore remained. Only the black, abysmal mouth of the ocean stared back at him.
</p>

<p>
    Maybe he'd been wrong. Maybe God really had forgiven her, and she had returned to Heaven.
</p>

<p>
    Frantically, the old man ran to the water. How could this be? She was meant to choose: embrace her 
    humanity or her death. There was no third path. How could she have escaped?
</p>

<p>
    As he drew closer, he was struck by a cruel reminder of his own humanity. She hadn't disappeared. 
    Her silhouette sat hunched in the sand. Her sobs folded into the rhythm of the waves. She felt so 
    heartbreakingly human.
</p>

<p>
    Immediately, he was flooded with guilt -- guilt that stung, but guilt that could still be soothed. 
    He could still cross the waterline, still ask if she was okay, and still walk away feeling like 
    he'd done his part. But if she had truly vanished? He wasn't sure which would have devastated him 
    more: the crack in his reality, or being a willing bystander of someone's death.
</p>

<p>
    "Excuse me, miss," the old man croaked. "Are you all right?"
</p>

<p>
    The woman's head snapped towards him, not startled, but guarded. "I'll leave. I didn't realize 
    this was private property."
</p>

<p>
    "No, no." He sighed. "Well, technically, this is my beach, but I'm not one to chase off someone in 
    pain."
</p>

<p>
    At that, the forceful resistance the woman had displayed crumbled instantly, and she began to 
    lament. "He said that he loves me. That the only reason he hasn't proposed to me yet is because he 
    isn't ready, but we've been dating for nine years so if he isn't ready now when will he ever be? I 
    never gave him an ultimatum because ultimatums are never fair and I don't want to force him to marry 
    me because that's definitely not healthy and a marriage stemming from obligation probably won't last 
    but at some point I have to choose myself... right? But, when I told him that I see myself getting 
    married soon, and that I'd like it to be with him, he'd start hiding away, and saying that maybe he 
    shouldn't do this, and that maybe I should find somebody who can give me what I want, and that he 
    definitely can't give up on his future. And I would have to grit my teeth and coax him and remind 
    him of how happy we are together and convince myself of how true happiness doesn't require labels but 
    why am I not in his future when I'm fighting so hard to keep him in mine?"
</p>

<p>
    The silence, echoing the last syllables trailing from the woman's lips, were harshly filled with the 
    old man's hysteria. "I'm sorry, darling. Love is never easy. It's just that, earlier, I'd imagined 
    you as an angel, choosing between humanity and death, and here you are, battling with one of the most 
    human experiences."
</p>

<p>
    It was unnervingly quiet. 
</p>

<p>
    Then, the woman spoke in the safety of her own breath. "You're all the same. Only thinking about 
    yourself, and never thinking twice about the people around you."
</p>

<p>
    This infuriated the old man. Hadn't he allowed to her to mourn on his property? Hadn't he gone to 
    check up on her? Hadn't he sacrificed his time for her sake? How dare she suggest that he was being 
    inconsiderate? He spat bitterly, "Perhaps your cynicism poisoned your relationship."
</p>

<p>
    The woman went still, as if the weight of his words had landed on her chest and pinned her to the 
    earth. The conversation gave way to the roar of the waves lapping at the woman's body, whom she 
    neither accepted nor rejected. As the tide grew higher, it seemed to be begging the woman to join 
    it, to surrender, to find solace in the benighted, enveloping arms of the ocean. 
</p>

<p>
    She didn't move. 
</p>

<p>
    The old man shifted uncomfortably. Maybe had had gone too far.
</p>

<p>
    He considered apologizing but decided against it. It would be more productive for her to angrily 
    leave so that he could finish his walk of his beach and she could rest in her home. She's young. 
    And if she was foolish enough to try so hard for something so futile, she'll fall in love with 
    somebody who loves her soon enough. He'd done his due diligence, and anything beyond this would be 
    useful for nobody. 
</p>

<p>
    Abruptly, the woman asked, "Everybody knows you take a walk along your beach exactly at sunset. 
    Regardless of the season, regardless of the weather, regardless of the time, if it's sunset, you'll 
    be on the beach. Why is that?"
</p>

<p>
    The old man wasn't sure if he felt annoyed that she had lied or moved that she might have sought 
    his company. "I'm an old man. I need to take care of my health."
</p>

<p>
    "I don't think that's the real reason. Because then you'd walk as soon as you get off work or after 
    dinner or at 6 PM sharp, but it's always during the sunset."
</p>

<p>
    "Seeing the light disappear reminds me that I haven't gone on my walk yet." 
</p>

<p>
    "But why are you here every day? You could wander in the town, take a day trip somewhere. Hell, you 
    could even walk counterclockwise, but it's always sunset, clockwise around the beach. Don't you want 
    some variety?"
</p>

<p>
    "People are creatures of habit."
</p>

<p>
    "You know what I think? I think it's because you think you should be doing it. You don't care about 
    your health or your beach or the scenery. You bring people over and they say 'Oh! It must be nice to 
    have a beach as your backyard. If I were you, I'd take a stroll everyday!' And that made you think 
    'Yeah, I guess I should be using the beach that I bought.' So everyday, at the last possible moment, 
    you fulfill this self-made obligation you tied to your property, and you walk along your beach to 
    prove to yourself that you really are making the most of it."
</p>

<p>
    The old man roared with laughter. "Darling, I have nothing to prove to myself. When you're older, 
    you'll realize ambition becomes less and less appealing, until finally, you'll have accomplished 
    everything you set out to do. I'm enjoying the fruit of the seeds I planted in my youth."
</p>

<p>
    "Are you happy?"
</p>

<p>
    "As happy as I could be."
</p>

<p>
    There was another bout of silence. "I know all the so-called right decisions are better for me long 
    term. If he doesn't want me now when the fervor of our love should be at its greatest, he'll always 
    feel unfulfilled with me. And I'll be on edge, waiting for the day that he realizes he made a 
    mistake and leaves me for the chance to be with the girl he's dreamed of. So I ended it. Everyone 
    said it was the right thing to do and I agree that it was the right thing to do but I really do 
    love him and it feels so wrong to walk away from somebody I love so much."
</p>

<p>
    "It's wise to not make decisions solely on feelings and impulse."
</p>

<p>
    "Fuck being patient and waiting for the one. Don't we deserve to be happy now? Isn't real love about 
    working through the differences together to continue that happiness? I think finding nothing wrong 
    is the greatest green flag there is. Meeting somebody decent just feels impossible, so is it wrong 
    for me to think that we should settle down with people who make us happy?"
</p>

<p>
    "Romance is a privilege, not a right."
</p>

<p>
    "And I get that, but I don't think I could ever be happy without love. Right now, I should be happy. 
    I'm not rich, but I'm not poor. I'm not sick. I eat delicious food. I do exciting things. And I'm 
    surrounded by people who I know love me. But I don't have anybody to call my own. Someone who would 
    devote their life to me as I would for them. To be honest with you, I don't even know if what I'm 
    describing is love. I'll be infatuated with somebody for months, and as I get to know them, I build 
    up so much resentment that I lose that infatuation. Maybe I don't miss love. Maybe I just miss what 
    I become when I think I'm loved. I know my friends and family love me, and I love them, but it feels 
    like my life is given purpose when I'm giving it my all to somebody. But every time I give it my all 
    to somebody, it like I never matter as much to them as they matter to me."
</p>

<p>
    "The most difficult decision you'll make is defining your life's meaning."
</p>

<p>
    "Don't you ever get lonely?"
</p>

<p>
    For once, the old man didn't respond immediately with a one line quip. The woman wondered if she 
    had overstepped. In all honesty, she wasn't even sure why she'd chosen this beach. Her phone was 
    filled with unanswered messages from concerned friends. Her roommate had left work early to check if 
    she was home. Her family had been searching for her all over town. But she'd chosen this beach, where 
    she'd known the old man would be, to wallow in her despair. As embarrassing as it was, a small part 
    of her had hoped he would come down to talk to her. Maybe she sought the honesty that only appears 
    during a conversation between two strangers. "No."
</p>

<p>
    Honesty her ass. "You really never get lonely, owning all this land, living in that big house, at an 
    age where all your friends are probably grandparents." 
</p>

<p>
    "No."
</p>

<p>
    It was too dark for the old man or the woman to see each other clearly. But it didn't matter. They 
    both continued to face forward, their tears drowned by the growing tide. 
</p>

<p>
    After that evening, the old man never saw the woman again. Maybe against all odds, she had reached 
    Heaven. Sometimes, he found himself lingering by the phone, his fingers tracing the cover of the dusty 
    address book. But in the end, he always told himself she was on another beach, mourning somebody else.
</p>

<p>
    And so, for as long as the sun touched the horizon, the old man's feet continued to touch the sand.
